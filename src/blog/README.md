# Introduction

I am a passionate computer programmer since I was twelve. 
During my life I spent a lot of effort learning new languages, programming patterns, system architecture, and even video game development. I have used a lot of open source projects but there was one thing missing.
For years I faced the same kind of development problems trying to solve them in different ways to find "the right way" or "the right fit" and I have gained a good level of flexibility in this activity.

I have asked myself many times how to become confident reading other programmer's code.
I looked for resources like yt channels and blogs but I have noticed that all these stuff were pretty general and do not cover real life examples of reading the actual code.

At the time I was not addressing to open source code but to my mates's code which I find sometimes very hard to read and understand. The original question was "How can I become confident with an unknown large codebase".

## I read the code

Then I changed my job. And one of my new mates is a very experienced senior programmer.
I consider (and I had many proves of this) him a genial programmer. He's not a friendly person. What I mean is that he has not the attitude to explain every detail but he gives advices.

I used to keep these advices pretty seriously. He sometimes says a sentence of about 10-20 words.
Behind these words there is an entire ocean to discover.

One time he said to me "I don't consider me a good programmer. I have just one attitude. I read the code. Read the code!"
This sentence gave me a prospective. Something that I did not fully understood and was a real revelation to me.

## Read the code... what does it mean?
Read the code... what does it mean? I have tried to read the code but I don't know how to make it! I spent a lot of time trying to read code without success... so how does him do that? he is a genius and thi is pretty clear to me but can I try to do that?

One day I discovered that in my life I have written tons of code using tons of open source projects without ever having looked at one of them. I have never put my eyes on any code since years.

## The first blood
So I have opened a random project on github.com - webpack. 
On the browser there were tons of files. A real nightmare. I felt overwhelmed and I felt like I could never do that.

I went to sleep pretty depressed feeling very inadequate. 

## Learning english
The next day I was trying to elaborate this feeling a little bit more and it came to my mind something that I have watched in a yt video some years about learning english by watching movies.
They said that you cannot learn anything if you watch a video that you understand less than 90%.
In other words you cannot benefit learning from a resource you don't understand almost at all.

## The second blood
Back to webpack instead of trying to figure out the general picture I tried to look at tiny aspects driven my curiosity.
I started to open a file and reading what's written inside. 
I could not yet figure out what that code was doing but instead of trying to look at 1000 files I was focusing on just one.

I started to ask myself why I was so confused reading that piece of code and I realized that I was knowing less than 90% of what I was reading.

I have heard those concepts hundreds of times but I figured out that I didn't know them at core. So I stopped trying to read that code and I started to learn what was "AROUND" that code.

## The interesting things are always "AROUND"
There is an entire ocean around the code that people write.
This was the start of a big journey. I warn you that this journey has no ending. You will learn incredible things;  things you have never dreamed about but you will never get know everything.
You will never get close to the end of the journey by any means but you will be a much more confident and better programmer than what was before.

It's not simple... but the benefits are great
I suggest you to follow your hearth and feed your mind with what you like to do and to learn driven by your curiosity.

This blog wants just to be a track of my personal journey
